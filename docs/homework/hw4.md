### Homework #4
1. What is the count of the prime
numbers when n = 300000?
1. Add a new function to the provided prime counter program or make a serial code using the same algorithim. Then, test the serial function (or code) with n=300000. Then report the count of the prime numbers and wall-clock time (elapsed time). Set n=300000 for all below questions.
2. Set the number of threads be 2 using OpenMP enviromental variable. Then, modify the program to test it without using scheduling. Report the wall-clock time for this case.
3. Test the program with “static” scheduling and report the wall-clock time.
4. Test the program with “static with chunk size 100” and report the wall-clock time.
5. Test the program with “dynamic” scheduling and report the wall-clock time.
6. Test the program with “dynamic with chunk size 100” and report the wall-clock time.
7. Test the program with “guided” scheduling and report the wall-clock time.
8. Test the program more with different scheduling and chunk sizes. What is your best
scenario to minimize the wall-clock time?
9. Report your conclusion from above benchmark tests.
